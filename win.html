        You beat Lucifer in Craps and he returns your wife as he promised.<br>
        You reunite with your wife and embrace her for the first time since you died.<br>
        As you cry with joy to finally see her again,<br>
        She asks, "Why did you save me?"<br>
        You reassure her that its because you are her husband, and that you love her<br>
        She says "Even after what I did to you?"<br>
        but you are unsure what she means<br>
        Out of guilt, she confesses, "On our last day on Earth, I killed you so that I could inherit all the money to your name and live with my lover in paradise"
